## Dinky

A small Godot game that integrates with Ink.

Initially based on the package and teaching Dylan put into a Unity version doing the same.

### Background

This short game was created for the [IGA](https://indiegameacademy.itch.io/)
Level 1 Visual Novel Class (#Cohort18!!!), which taught an Ink integration with
Unity - much thanks to Dylan and IGA for the architecture and features in that
implementation!

I used that as inspiration for a Godot rewrite, which resulted in this repo.
I'm hopeful to spin a few stories and godot utils out of this....sometime soon?

Much thanks to ephread for the [inkgd plugin](https://github.com/ephread/inkgd).

I ran into a handful of issues getting CI working, and getting ink working via a
godot web export, but most things seem fine now? Feel free to reach out if you
want help getting it running yourself!
